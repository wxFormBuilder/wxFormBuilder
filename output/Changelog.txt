* FS#425 - ListBook: C++ code instead of Python code 

03/06/2009 Version 3.01.60 (Beta)
* Moved the 'event_handler' type to the Forms plug-in. This allows different 
  event handling methods to be used per Frame/Dialog/Panel. This makes it even
  easier to create Dialogs that don't need any inherited class to work.
* Removed the 'virtual_decl' 'event_handler' method because it seemed like hassle
  to get a linker error instead of a compiler error. It also cleans up the options
  a bit.

02/06/2009 Version 3.01.59 (Beta)
* FS#367 - Project-Properties: encoding is ignored. Fixed ANSII file generation - Loaden
* FS#357 - wxFB overrides file without confirmation from user. - hykwok

  This is now optional, see the "disconnect_events" property of the Project object.
* FS#337 - "Incorrect Vertical Toolbar Rendering"
* FS#328 - "Unknown style flag wxTE_BESTWRAP for wxTextCtrl"
  Removed the flag, it is the default, and #define'd to 0x0000, so it was pointless anyway.
* FS#339 - "wx/icon.h not included when using resource icons in wxToolBar"
^ Removed the two project-level XRC properties, "bitmaps" and "icons". 
  These never worked properly, and wxFB is not the right place to enter that information,
  a standalone XRC file written with any text-editor would be much better.
  This was prompted by, and caused the closure of, these issues:
  FS#340 - "bitmap resources are unnamed, preventing use of wxXmlResource::Get()->LoadBitmap()" 
  FS#329 - "XRC Properties - Follow on"

02/01/2008 Version 3.00.54 (RC6)
* FS#308 - Bugs in non-interactive (-g) mode
  Note: stderr is not normally available on Windows for GUI apps.
        If -g is used, all logging goes to stderr and debug output.
		Either start the process with a pipe for stderr (most IDEs will do this
		for you), or use a Debug Viewer to watch the output.
* FS#311 - wxFB 3.0 RC5 still generating incorrect wxMenu(item) code

01/15/2008 Version 3.00.53 (RC5)
* Fixed missing C++ code generation for menu separators and menu item bitmaps.

+ Added wxSL_BOTH style flag to wxSlider.
+ Added encoding check for all loaded xml files. The means that the xml files
  must have a declaration, and the encoding must be UTF-8. If it is not, wxFB
  will offer to convert the file, from a user chosen original encoding. This
  resolves FS#69.
+ Add the .fbp extension when saving if none is chosen. (this is really only
  an linux issue)
+ Added a shortcut to the "XRC Window" menu item.
+ Added property to skip frame's main sizer generation in certain cases for xrc code

  registry.
^ Single Instance Stuff:
    Prefixed lockfiles with '.' so they are hidden.
    Switched using "localhost" to "127.0.0.1", "localhost" was not working for me.

    is brought to the front.
    Moved single instance stuff to wxfbipc.cpp/h.

12-22-2006 Version 3.00.13 (Beta 2)
* Now generating all empty strings as wxEmptyString. This resolves FS#52.
* wxRadioBox can now use internationalization on its label, too.
  This resolves FS#50.
* Generation of Microsoft BOM on UTF-8 files is now disabled on
  platforms other than WXMSW. This resolves FS#46.
* Fixed crash when editing the value of a wxTextCtrl in the designer,
  under certain conditions. This resolves FS#45.

12-8-2006 Version 3.00.12 (Beta 2)
* Fixed problems with paths including non-English characters.
  wxFB can now be installed to such paths, as well as open/save projects,
  generate code, and import xrc files. This resolves FS#49.
* Now only allowing one choice for non_flexible_grow_mode and for
  flexible_direction on wxFlexGridSizer. This resolves FS#56.

12-4-2006 Version 3.00.11 (Beta 2)
* Now generating user_headers include statements above the generated
  header include. This resolves FS#55.
* Fixed FS#51 - "notebook-like objects errors while they are included into each other"
* Fixed FS#59 - "wxCheckListBox: incorrect class name in XRC"
* Fixed  FS#62 - "Sub-Classing top level items doesn't work."
  This was a big change. The subclass property is now a parent property with two
  children: name and header. The name is the subclass name, and header is the
  header to include so that the subclass is defined while building. The header
  is placed into the correct generated file depending on whether a form or control
  is being subclassed. This removes most of the purposed of the "user_headers"
  property, so it has been removed. A "precompiled_header" property was added,
  with default value of "wx/wxprec.h". This fix necessitated the creation of a "parent"
  property type, of which "subclass" is the only example. More information on parent
  properties will soon be added to the wiki.

11-15-2006 Version 3.00.10 (Beta 2)
* Fixed FS#63 - "Size/minimum-size is not working."
* Fixed FS#60 - "wxFlexGridSizer vgap/hgap if empty they get generated empty."
  This was actually a bug with most numerical properties. Added a "uint" property
  type to solve this. Most numerical properties are now unsigned integers, so the
  property grid will not let it remain blank, and negative numbers are not accepted.
  This approach is good because it is clear to the user what will happen when the
  code is generated.
* Fixed FS#66 - "Adding common controls to toolbar."
* Fixed FS#65 - "Unfriendly object tree."
* Implemented FS#68 - "Smart enable/disable of toolbar items."
  This was already mostly done. Just needed to enable/disable the appropriate alignment
  buttons for wxBoxSizer and wxStaticBoxSizer.

10-30-2006 Version 3.00.09 (Beta 2)
* Fixed moving left, right, and into a new wxBoxSizer for spacers.
* Fixed FS#72 - "When editing a property in the property grid, it is lost when you click away."
* Fixed FS#73 - "Toolbar tools not selecting the object in the object tree."
* Fixed FS#71 - "wxSplitter window sashpos not being set."

10-27-2006 Version 3.00.08 (Beta 2)
* ID_DEFAULT is no longer defined when not used.
* Ids beginning with "wxID_" are no longer defined, this is to avoid redefining
  wxWidgets special identifiers.
* Ids for forms now use the "id" property instead of being hardcoded to -1.
* Fixed wxSlider XRC generation for the minValue and maxValue properties.

10-26-2006 Version 3.00.07 (Beta 2)
^ wxID_ANY is now the default id.
^ Object tree now saves its state.
^ Object tree now also scrolls horizontally when selecting an object.

10-25-2006 Version 3.00.06 (Beta 2)
^ Implemented FS#26 - "Chronological id creation."

+ Added min_pane_size and sashsize properties to wxSplitterWindow.
+ Added maximum size property to wxWindow properties.

10-20-2006 Version 3.00.05 (Beta 2)
+ Implemented FS#48 - "Improve error notification when a plugin is missing."
  If widgets are missing, the project will not load at all.
+ Added a boolean "xrc_skip_sizer" property to Frame. The default is value is true.
  When true, the main sizer of the frame will not be generated in XRC, if the sizer
  only has one child. This is a workaround for a wx bug that ignores the "size"
  property of the frame if it has a sizer. This resolves FS#74.
+ Added encoding check for all loaded xml files.

10-13-2006 Version 3.00.04 (Beta 1)
* Fixed visual editor for subpanels.
* Fixed circular subclassing. This resolves FS#32.
* Fixed Alt-Tab icon. This resolves FS#34.

* Fixed wxWindow settings code generation.

10-07-2006 Version 3.00.02 (Beta 1)
* Fixed generation bugs in submenu and wxCheckList (now wxCheckListBox)
  These were caused by subclass in version 2.00.75. This closes FS#20.
* Changed title of save dialog box from "Open Project" to "Save Project"
  This closes FS#18.
* Fixed xrc generation of static bitmap using patch supplied by henrique.
  This closes FS#16
* Added subclassing on forms. This closes FS#21.
* Fixed C++ output of value property for wxGauge.
+ Added center property for wxDialog and wxFrame. This closes FS#17.
