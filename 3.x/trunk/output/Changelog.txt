  wxDialog to using SetSizeHints.

+ The selection border can be drawn even when it extends beyond the edge of
  the inner content panel.
+ Catching left clicks on the title bar of innerframe in order to select it.
+ Added wxSL_BOTH style flag to wxSlider.
+ Added encoding check for all loaded xml files. The means that the xml files
  must have a declaration, and the encoding must be UTF-8. If it is not, wxFB
  will offer to convert the file, from a user chosen original encoding. This
  resolves FS#69.
+ Add the .fbp extension when saving if none is chosen. (this is really only
  an linux issue)
+ Added a shortcut to the "XRC Window" menu item.
+ Added property to skip frame's main sizer generation in certain cases for xrc code
* Now using ints instead of uints for min, max, and val on wxSlider.
* Now remembering right splitter size in classic gui.
* Fixed wxSlider XRC generation for the minValue and maxValue properties.
* Status bar now stays on the bottom of the frame even when the sizer is empty.
- Removed SetVendorName, it just added a level to the hierarchy in the windows
  registry.
^ Single Instance Stuff:
    Prefixed lockfiles with '.' so they are hidden.
    Switched using "localhost" to "127.0.0.1", "localhost" was not working for me.
    Added a status bar message in the second instance when the first instance
    is brought to the front.
    Moved single instance stuff to wxfbipc.cpp/h.
^ General innerframe rendering updates.

12-22-2006 Version 3.00.13 (Beta 2)
* Now generating all empty strings as wxEmptyString. This resolves FS#52.
* wxRadioBox can now use internationalization on its label, too.
  This resolves FS#50.
* Generation of Microsoft BOM on UTF-8 files is now disabled on
  platforms other than WXMSW. This resolves FS#46.
* Fixed crash when editing the value of a wxTextCtrl in the designer,
  under certain conditions. This resolves FS#45.

12-8-2006 Version 3.00.12 (Beta 2)
* Fixed problems with paths including non-English characters.
  wxFB can now be installed to such paths, as well as open/save projects,
  generate code, and import xrc files. This resolves FS#49.
* Now only allowing one choice for non_flexible_grow_mode and for
  flexible_direction on wxFlexGridSizer. This resolves FS#56.

12-4-2006 Version 3.00.11 (Beta 2)
* Now generating user_headers include statements above the generated
  header include. This resolves FS#55.
* Fixed FS#51 — "notebook-like objects errors while they are included into each other"
* Fixed FS#59 — "wxCheckListBox: incorrect class name in XRC"
* Fixed  FS#62 — "Sub-Classing top level items doesn't work."
  This was a big change. The subclass property is now a parent property with two
  children: name and header. The name is the subclass name, and header is the
  header to include so that the subclass is defined while building. The header
  is placed into the correct generated file depending on whether a form or control
  is being subclassed. This removes most of the purposed of the "user_headers"
  property, so it has been removed. A "precompiled_header" property was added,
  with default value of "wx/wxprec.h". This fix necessitated the creation of a "parent"
  property type, of which "subclass" is the only example. More information on parent
  properties will soon be added to the wiki.

11-15-2006 Version 3.00.10 (Beta 2)
* Fixed FS#63 — "Size/minimum-size is not working."
* Fixed FS#60 — "wxFlexGridSizer vgap/hgap if empty they get generated empty."
  This was actually a bug with most numerical properties. Added a "uint" property
  type to solve this. Most numerical properties are now unsigned integers, so the
  property grid will not let it remain blank, and negative numbers are not accepted.
  This approach is good because it is clear to the user what will happen when the
  code is generated.
* Fixed FS#66 — "Adding common controls to toolbar."
* Fixed FS#65 — "Unfriendly object tree."
* Implemented FS#68 — "Smart enable/disable of toolbar items."
  This was already mostly done. Just needed to enable/disable the appropriate alignment
  buttons for wxBoxSizer and wxStaticBoxSizer.

10-30-2006 Version 3.00.09 (Beta 2)
* Fixed moving left, right, and into a new wxBoxSizer for spacers.
* Fixed FS#72 — "When editing a property in the property grid, it is lost when you click away."
* Fixed FS#73 — "Toolbar tools not selecting the object in the object tree."
* Fixed FS#71 — "wxSplitter window sashpos not being set."

10-27-2006 Version 3.00.08 (Beta 2)
* ID_DEFAULT is no longer defined when not used.
* Ids beginning with "wxID_" are no longer defined, this is to avoid redefining
  wxWidgets special identifiers.
* Ids for forms now use the "id" property instead of being hardcoded to -1.
* Fixed wxSlider XRC generation for the minValue and maxValue properties.

10-26-2006 Version 3.00.07 (Beta 2)
^ wxID_ANY is now the default id.
^ Object tree now saves its state.
^ Object tree now also scrolls horizontally when selecting an object.
^ Added class name and line to error message for unknown classes when importing xrc.
^ Improved both C++ and XRC code generation for wxSplitterWindow.

10-25-2006 Version 3.00.06 (Beta 2)
^ Implemented FS#26 — "Chronological id creation."
+ Added support for using wxSplitterWindow with only one child.
+ Added min_pane_size and sashsize properties to wxSplitterWindow.
+ Added maximum size property to wxWindow properties.

10-20-2006 Version 3.00.05 (Beta 2)
+ Implemented FS#48 — "Improve error notification when a plugin is missing."
  If widgets are missing, the project will not load at all.
+ Added a boolean "xrc_skip_sizer" property to Frame. The default is value is true.
  When true, the main sizer of the frame will not be generated in XRC, if the sizer
  only has one child. This is a workaround for a wx bug that ignores the "size"
  property of the frame if it has a sizer. This resolves FS#74.
+ Added encoding check for all loaded xml files.
